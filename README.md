# Job_Application_Automation

## Overview
**Job_Application_Automation** is a Python-based application designed to assist job seekers in automating the job application process. This tool extracts key information from a job seeker's resume (e.g., personal details, work experience, skills, education) and automatically populates the relevant fields on job application forms across various platforms. This solution aims to save time and reduce the repetitive work involved in job applications.

With the power of modern AI, the application provides an intelligent, fast, and efficient way to streamline job application submissions.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Job_Application_Automation.git
    cd Job_Application_Automation
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up environment variables for secure API keys using a `.env` file. Make sure to configure it with the appropriate keys:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the app** using Streamlit:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. **Upload your Resume**: Select the PDF resume you want to use for the application.

4. **Form Auto-Fill**: Once the resume is uploaded, the system will parse the resume using AI, extract relevant data, and fill out the respective fields in the job application form.

5. **Submit the Application**: After auto-filling the form, review the details, and submit it directly from the web interface.

## Example Workflow
1. **Upload Resume**: Job seeker uploads their resume in PDF format.
2. **AI Processing**: Google's Generative AI processes the resume and extracts data such as name, contact details, work experience, skills, and education.
3. **Automatic Field Filling**: The extracted data is used to automatically fill out application forms.
4. **Submit Applications**: The filled application form is ready for submission, saving the job seeker time and effort.
